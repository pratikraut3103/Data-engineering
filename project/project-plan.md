## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The primary objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between the number of vehicles sold and the corresponding levels of carbon emissions, specifically focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Understanding this relationship is vital for developing effective strategies to combat climate change. This study aims to elucidate how fluctuations in vehicle sales impact environmental pollution, providing valuable insights into the effects of vehicle growth on carbon emissions. The findings will help inform decisions to promote sustainable transportation solutions, ultimately contributing to efforts to mitigate climate change.
